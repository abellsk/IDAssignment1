# Assignment 1
Billie Eillish website.
This website is about billie eillish a singer and songwriter. A website to show off one of her new songs
and for others to view tour dates and check out other music about her

Design process
I wanted the design to look as professional as possible, to look like an actual webiste, i took references to billie's original website but then decided to do a different album for her instead of her latest album to avoid me copying or having my website similiar to hers.

This website is promote billie eillish's new album, "when we all fall asleep where do we go?" for users to see whats new in her album, what are the song contents and also her tour schedule. There is also a last page called 'music', where users can take a look at all her albums and they will be redirected to that specific spotify page.

Features
- In the navigation header bar, there are social icons there that have been made and and illustrated by me through photoshop. Each icon will redirect users to billie's respective social media page.

- Theres is a live video of Billie performing 'bad guy' live. I couldnt get the original video to promote her due to copyright issues so I used this instead.

- There is a hero-image in the middle of the index page. I used her album cover and photoshopped it to add text such as "when we all fall asleep where do we go" and "album out now" where i found the font on the internet and added it in. There will be a BUTTON that says 'stream / download' which will redirect users to the billie's offiial linktree page where they can stream or download her songs on multiple platforms.

- "check it out" text below the album cover at the index page also redirects users to her official linktree page where they can stream or download her songs on multiple platforms.

- In the schedule page, there will be contents on where and when her next tour will be with 2 buttons, One is the ticket another is the check seats. Both button will redirect users to another html page that says "sorry!" as due to the covid pandemic, there will be no tour or concert. Users can go back to schedule page as there is a button at the covid.html page.

- In the last page, the music page, there will be a list of all billies album covers, and when hovered, will reduce the opacity, so the user is aware that it is clickable. Each album picture will redirect them to respecitive spotify music page where they can listen to her music when clicked on.

Technologies used
- I have used HTML and CSS, with some flexbox and responsive elements to construct my projects.

Testing
- You can try interacting with the video to see if the videos play, or even under the schedule page, you can try clicking on the 'tickets' button and it should redirect you to the covid page.

Notes 
- Responsive isnt well done, except for 'Moto G4' mode. Everything else is not optimized for responsive.

Credits.
- Music songlist was copied and referenced from google and spotify.

Media Pictures
- All album pictures were retrieved from spotify.
- Billie eilish Logo was made by me by using font found in google.
