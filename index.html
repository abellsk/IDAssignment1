              <h2>About Billie.</h2>
              <p>
                  Born and raised in Los Angeles, Eilish grew up in a household of actors and musicians 
                  and was home-schooled along with her brother Finneas O'Connell (the Slightlys). At the 
                  age of eight, she joined the Los Angeles Children's Choir, developing the soulful vocals 
                  that would later appear on her early singles. At last yearâ€™s Grammys, Eilish became just
                  the second artist in Grammy history to sweep the Big Four categories: album of the year,
                  record of the year, song of the year and best new artist. At the age of 19, Eilish now owns 
                  seven Grammys.
